# SummarizeHumanActivityData


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set as part of the Coursera Data Science specialization. For this purpose a script is created that downloads human activity regocnition data that is split into several files.

After downloading the script processes
1. It Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
2. It applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
3. It appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
4. It creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and wirtes the result to a txt file.

The Repository consists of:

-this README file
-the R script "SummarizeHumanActivityData"
-the outputfile "tidyData.txt"
-a Codebook describing the variables
